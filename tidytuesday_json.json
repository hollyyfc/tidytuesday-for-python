        "description": "The data this week comes from theProject FeederWatch. FeederWatch is a November-April survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, community areas, and other locales in North America. Citizen scientists could birds in areas with plantings, habitat, water, or food that attracts birds. The schedule is completely flexible. People count birds as long as they like on days of their choosing, then enter their counts online. This allows anyone to track what is happening to birds around your home and to contribute to a continental data-set of bird distribution and abundance. FeederWatch data show which bird species visit feeders at thousands of locations across the continent every winter. The data also indicate how many individuals of each species are seen. This information can be used to measure changes in the winter ranges and abundances of bird species over time. A subset of the 2021 data is included for this TidyTuesday, but data available through 1988 is available for download onFeederWatch Raw Dataset Downloads page Project FeederWatch is operated by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada. Since 2016, Project FeederWatch has been sponsored by Wild Bird Unlimited. Acknowledging FeederWatch. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada are committed to making data gathered through our citizen science programs freely accessible to students, journalists, and the general public.\" \"This unique dataset is completely dependent on the efforts of our network of volunteer participants. We ask that all data analysts give credit to the thousands of participants who have made FeederWatch possible, as well as to Birds Canada and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for developing and managing the program.\" Examples of analysesare included with the raw data and there is a section toExplorethe data.

Between 2013 and 2017, Roland Kays et al. convinced hundreds of volunteers in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and New Zealand to strap GPS sensors on their pet cats. The aforelinked datasets include each cat's characteristics (such as age, sex, neuter status, hunting habits) and time-stamped GPS pings. When using this dataset, please cite the original article.

For TidyTuesday we've used data through February 2021, but the full dataset, with data through the present, is available in theOSF project. In this project, they synthesize an analysis-ready data set that tracks cage-free hens and the supply of cage-free eggs relative to the overall numbers of hens and table eggs in the United States. The data set is based on reports produced by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which are published weekly or monthly. They supplement these data with definitions and a taxonomy of egg products drawn from USDA and industry publications. The data include flock size (both absolute and relative) and egg production of cage-free hens as well as all table-egg-laying hens in the US, collected to understand the impact of the industry's cage-free transition on hens. Data coverage ranges from December 2007 to February 2021. This data was already cleaned for the report. Raw data is also available atUS Egg Production Dataset.",

Thank you for sharing your research,@joeroe! According to thesocial media thread about this dataset: Eight 'founder crops' — emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, barley, lentil, pea, chickpea, bitter vetch, and flax — have long been thought to have been the bedrock of #Neolithic economies. ... We found that Neolithic economies were much more diverse than previously thought, incorporating dozens of species of cereals, legumes, small-seeded grasses, brassicas, pseudocereals, sedges, flowering plants, trees, and shrubs. Free-threshing wheat, grass pea, faba bean, and ‘new' glume wheat were especially widely cultivated. Read the thread for context about this data!",

The Portal Project is a long-term ecological study being conducted near Portal, AZ. Since 1977, the site has been used to study the interactions among rodents, ants and plants and their respective responses to climate. To study the interactions among organisms, they experimentally manipulate access to 24 study plots. This study has produced over 100 scientific papers and is one of the longest running ecological studies in the U.S. TheWeecology research groupmonitors rodents, plants, ants, and weather. All data from the Portal Project are made openly available in near real-time so that they can provide the maximum benefit to scientific research and outreach. The core dataset is managed using an automated living data workflow run using GitHub and Continuous Analysis. This dataset focuses on the rodent data. Full data is available through these resources: The Portal Project data can also be accessed through the Data Retriever, a package manager for data. Data Retriever A teaching focused version of the dataset is also maintained with some of the complexities of the data removed to make it easy to use for computational training purposes. This dataset serves as the core dataset for theData Carpentry Ecologymaterial and has been downloaded almost 50,000 times. Thanks to @ethanwhite for the data cleaning script. This script downloads the data using the{portalr}package. It filters for the species and plot data, and years greater than 1977.",

        "description": "Happy Mothers Day! The data this week comes from theNational Database of Childcare Prices. The National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) is the most comprehensive federal source of childcare prices at the county level. The database offers childcare price data by childcare provider type, age of children, and county characteristics. Data are available from 2008 to 2018. Thanks this week to Thomas Mock for the submission, with a hat tip toJon Schwabish on Twitterfor pointing out the lack of labels on the original government-posted map. Note: This dataset implies that \"both parents\" means one man and one woman. We recognize that this does not reflect the reality of every loving family.",

These are lists of the 100 known verified oldest people sorted in descending order by age in years and days. The oldest person ever whose age has been independently verified is Jeanne Calment (1875–1997) of France, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days. The oldest verified man ever is Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013) of Japan, who lived to the age of 116 years and 54 days. The oldest known living person is Maria Branyas of Spain, aged 116 years, 85 days. The oldest known living man is Juan Vicente Pérez of Venezuela, aged 114 years, 1 day. The 100 oldest women have, on average, lived several years longer than the 100 oldest men. No data cleaning.

So, if you're looking how to learn how to work with this data, lessons are already available! Data is available throughFigshare. CITATION: Woodhouse, Philip; Veldwisch, Gert Jan; Brockington, Daniel; Komakech, Hans C.; Manjichi, Angela; Venot, Jean-Philippe (2018): SAFI Survey Results. doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.6262019.v1 SAFI (Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation) is a currently running project which is looking at farming and irrigation methods. This is survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data is then sent back to a central server. The server can be used to download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. This is a teaching version of the collected data that we will be using. It is not the full dataset. The survey covered such things as; household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and types of livestock) and details about the household members. The basic teaching dataset used in these lessons is a subset of the JSON dataset that has been converted into CSV format. Data was cleaned for the Data Carpentry Social Science lessons.

        "description": "The data this week comes from theNASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4). This datasets are tables of global and hemispheric monthly means and zonal annual means. They combine land-surface, air and sea-surface water temperature anomalies (Land-Ocean Temperature Index, L-OTI). The values in the tables are deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means. The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis version 4 (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change. Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using current data files from NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations) and ERSST v5 (ocean areas), combined as described in their publications Hansen et al. (2010) and Lenssen et al. (2019). These updated files incorporate reports for the previous month and also late reports and corrections for earlier months. When comparing seasonal temperatures, it is convenient to use “meteorological seasons” based on temperature and defined as groupings of whole months. Thus, Dec-Jan-Feb (DJF) is the Northern Hemisphere meteorological winter, Mar-Apr-May (MAM) is N.H. meteorological spring, Jun-Jul-Aug (JJA) is N.H. meteorological summer and Sep-Oct-Nov (SON) is N.H. meteorological autumn. String these four seasons together and you have the meteorological year that begins on Dec. 1 and ends on Nov. 30 (D-N). The full year is Jan to Dec (J-D).Brian Bartling An analysis and more information on the data can be found in Lenssen, N., G. Schmidt, J. Hansen, M. Menne, A. Persin, R. Ruedy, and D. Zyss, 2019: Improvements in the GISTEMP uncertainty model. J. Geophys. Res. Atmos., 124, no. 12, 6307-6326, doi:10.1029/2018JD029522.

        "description": "The data this week comes from themedicaldata R package. This is a data package from Peter Higgins, with 19 medical datasets for teaching Reproducible Medical Research with R. We're using thescurvy dataset. Source: This data set is from a study published in 1757 in A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts, by James Lind. This data set contains 12 participants with scurvy. In 1757, it was not known that scurvy is a manifestation of vitamin C deficiency. A variety of remedies had been anecdotally reported, but Lind was the first to test different regimens of acidic substances (including citrus fruits) against each other in a randomized, controlled trial. 6 distinct therapies were tested in 12 seamen with symptomatic scurvy, who were selected for similar severity. Six days of therapy were provided, and endpoints were reported in the text at the end of 6 days. These include rotting of the gums, skin sores, weakness of the knees, and lassitude, which are described in terms of severity. These have been translated into Likert scales from 0(none) to 3(severe). A dichotomous endpoint, fitness for duty, was also reported. Scurvy was a common affliction of seamen on long voyages, leading to mouth sores, skin lesions, weakness of the knees, and lassitude. Scurvy could be fatal on long voyages. James Lind reported the treatment of 12 seamen with scurvy in 1757, in _A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts). This 476 page bloviation can be found scanned to the Google Books website A Treatise on the Scurvy. Pages 149-153 are a rare gem among what can be generously described as 400+ pages of evidence-free blathering, and these 4 pages may represent the first report of a controlled clinical trial. Lind was the ship’s surgeon on board the HMS Salisbury, and had a number of scurvy-affected seamen at his disposal. Many remedies had been described and advocated for, with no more than anecdotal evidence. On May 20, 1747, Lind decided to try the 6 therapies on the Salisbury in a comparative study in 12 affected seamen. He selected 12 with roughly similar severity, with notable skin and mouth sores, weakness of the knees, and significant lassitude, making them unfit for duty. They each received the standard shipboard diet of gruel and mutton broth, supplemented with occasional biscuits and puddings. Each treatment was a dietary supplement (including citrus fruits) or a medicinal. This data frame was reconstructed from Lind’s account as recorded on these 4 pages, with his estimates of severity translated to a 4 point Likert scale (0-3) for each of the symptoms he described at his chosen endpoint on day 6. A somewhat fanciful study_id variable was added, along with detailed descriptions of the dosing schedule of each treatment. Of note, there is some dispute about whether this was truly the first clinical trial, or whether it actually happened, as there are no contemporaneous corroborating accounts. See link about the historical debate. Lind reported that the seamen treated with 2 lemons and an orange daily did best, followed by those treated with cider. Those treated with elixir of vitriol only had improvement in mouth sores. One imagines that acidic substances (like dilute sulfuric acid, vinegar, cider, and citrus fruits) might have been rather painful on these mouth sores. Unfortunately, the burial of the 4 valuable pages of data in 476 pages of noise, a publication delay of 10 years, and Lind’s half-hearted conclusions (he was focused on acidity), meant that it took until 1795 before the British Navy mandated daily limes for seamen. The first column was removed from the scurvy.csv file available athttps://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/tree/master/data-raw.",

There are two datasets this week for which the rows align, but the values might not precisely line up for a clean join -- a case you often have to deal with in real-world data.",

Regression-based union wage gap estimates are presented economy-wide, for demographic groups, and sectors (private/public, industries). Union wage gaps are higher in the private than in the public sector, higher for men than women, roughly similar for black and white men, and much higher for Hispanic men than for Hispanic women.

Workers who do not report earnings but instead have them imputed [i.e., assigned] by the Census are removed from the estimation samples in all years, except 1994 and 1995 when imputed earners cannot be identified.

These activities form the basis of human behavior, and because of the global integration of societies and economies, many of these activities interact across national borders. This project estimates how all humans spend their time using a generalized, physical outcome–based categorization that facilitates the integration of data from hundreds of diverse datasets.

The CRAN collaboration graph consists of R package developers who are connected if they appear together as authors of an R package in the DESCRIPTION file. The “Hadley number” is defined as the distance of R developers to Hadley Wickham in the collaboration graph. See theREADME of the GitHub projectfor a fun exploration of the data, and to see how it was gathered. SeeWriting R Extensionsfor more information about the fields in this dataset. The data was mostly cleaned byDavid Schoch. Additional cleaning was performed to save simple representations of the graph, and then to check that it worked.",

What is Ted Lasso and who is Roy Kent? Ted Lassois a TV show that \"follows Ted Lasso, an American college football coach who is hired to coach an English soccer team with the secret intention that his inexperience will lead it to failure, but whose folksy, optimistic leadership proves unexpectedly successful.\" Roy Kentis one of the main characters who goes from captain of AFC Richmond to one of the coaches. Particularly in early seasons, he's a man of few words, but many of them are f**k, expressed in various moods - mad, sad, happy, amused, loving, surprised, thoughtful, and joyous. This dataset includes the number, percentage, and context of f**k used in the show for each episode. Source Created by Deepsha Menghani by watching the show and counting the number of F-cks used in sentences and as gestures. The data was collected and created as an R package by Deepsha Menghani.",

Jake Thompson is a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. The data comes from Genius and the Spotify API. There are three main datasets. The first is taylor_album_songs, which includes lyrics and audio features from the Spotify API for all songs on Taylor’s official studio albums. Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm, etc.), and non-Taylor-owned albums that have a Taylor-owned alternative (e.g., Fearless is excluded in favor of Fearless (Taylor’s Version)). We stan artists owning their own songs. You can access Taylor’s entire discography with taylor_all_songs. This includes all of the songs in taylor_album_songs plus EPs, individual singles, and the original versions of albums that have been re-released as Taylor’s Version. Finally, there is a small data set, taylor_albums, summarizing Taylor’s album release history. Information on the audio features in the dataset from Spotify are included in theirAPI documentation. For your visualizations, the {taylor} package comes with it’s own class of color palettes, inspired by the work of Josiah Parry in the{cpcinema}package. You might also be interested in thetayoRswift packageby Alex Stephenson, a ggplot2 color palette based on Taylor Swift album covers. \"For when your colors absolutely should not be excluded from the narrative.\"",

        "description": "The virtualR/Pharma Conferenceis happening this week! To celebrate, we're exploring Patient Risk Profiles. Thank you toJenna Repsfor preparing this week's data! This dataset contains 100 simulated patient's medical history features and the predicted 1-year risk of 14 outcomes based on each patient's medical history features. The predictions used real logistic regression models developed on a large real world healthcare dataset. Note: We didnotclean the column names this week. This data looks more like the sort of data you're likely to encounter in the wild, so we thought it would be good practice to work with it as-is. Clean data provided by the R/Pharma team!",

Since urban legends are often a means of expressing our fears about the dangers that ripple just beneath the surface of our seemingly calm and untroubled world, it should come as no surprise that horror legends are one of urban folklore's richest veins. We worry about the terrible accidents we're powerless to prevent, and we fear anonymous killers who choose victims at random. We cannot protect ourselves from the venomous animals who slither undetected into the places where we work, play, and shop, nor can we stop the onslaught of insects who invade our homes and our bodies. We're repulsed by the contaminants that may lurk in our food. We're afraid of foreigners and foreign places. We fear for our childrens' safety in a world full of drugs, kidnappers, and poisons. We never know what gruesome discovery may be waiting around the next corner. And even if we somehow escape all of these horrors, our own vanities may do us in. You might want to dig into the details of the articles this week -- particularly if the rating is \"mixture\". Each observation includes the URL to that article, which you can open directly from R with theutils::browseURL()function.",

        "description": "Our World in Data released anew report on life expectancy, and analysis and interpretations are making the rounds this week, and you can join in too! We had a dataset on Global Life Expectancy on2018-07-03, so if you're a long time tidytuesday-er, this is a chance for some new analyses. The data this week comes theOur World in Data Life Expectancy report, specifically the figures in thekey insightssection. The source for this data is from United Nations World Population Prospects (2022); Human Mortality Database (2023); Zijdeman, Richard and Filipa Ribeira da Silva (2015),Life Expectancy at Birth (Total); Riley, J.C. (2005),Estimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy 1800-2001, Population and Development Review, 31: 537-543. Minor processing by Our World in Data. Across the world, people are living longer. In 1900, the average life expectancy of a newborn was 32 years. By 2021 this had more than doubled to 71 years. But where, when, how, and why has this dramatic change occurred? To understand it, we can look at data on life expectancy worldwide. The large reduction in child mortality has played an important role in increasing life expectancy. But life expectancy has increased at all ages. Infants, children, adults, and the elderly are all less likely to die than in the past, and death is being delayed. This remarkable shift results from advances in medicine, public health, and living standards. Along with it, many predictions of the ‘limit’ of life expectancy have been broken. On the Our World in Data Life Expectancy page, you will find global data and research on life expectancy and related measures of longevity: the probability of death at a given age, the sex gap in life expectancy, lifespan inequality within countries, and more. Data was downloaded from the tables for the figures in theKey Insights sectionof the Life Expectancy article. Column names were changed to make the data easier to work with.",

The dataset this week comes from\"Historical Trends in R Package Structure and Interdependency on CRAN\"by Mark Padgham and Noam Ross. In that paper, they use the{pkgstats}R package to analyze the structure of R packages over time, using an archive of all packages onCRANas of 2022-11-22. We've provided csv versions of two ofthe datasets from that paper. The paper focuses on package characteristics over time. It might be interesting to look at the distribution of similar features (such as lines of code) across packages. If you're unfamiliar with some of the terminology in this dataset, you might find theR Packagesbook by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan helpful. If you would like to dive deeper, you can download the larger dataset with this code: The authors provided mostly [clean data](https://zenodo.org/records/7414296. We chose one of their datasets, lightly cleaned the data, and saved it as a CSV. We also split theexternal_callsdata into two files, one for calls to functions in other files in the same package (internal_calls.csv) and one for calls to functions in other packages (external_calls.csv).",

The dataset this week comes fromStatistics Canada, theNHL team list endpoint, and theNHL API. The dataset was inspired by the blogAre Birth Dates Still Destiny for Canadian NHL Players?by JLaw (viahttps://universeodon.com/@jlaw/111522860812359901)! In the first chapterMalcolm Gladwell’s Outliershe discusses how in Canadian Junior Hockey there is a higher likelihood for players to be born in the first quarter of the year. Because these kids are older within their year they make all the important teams at a young age which gets them better resources for skill development and so on. While it seems clear that more players are born in the first few months of the year, what isn’t explored is whether or not this would be expected. Maybe more people in Canada in general are born earlier in the year. I will explore whether Gladwell’s result is expected as well as whether this is still true in today’s NHL for Canadian-born players. Can you reproduce JLaw's results? What else can you find in the NHL player data?",

Thank youKelsey E Gonzalezfor the dataset suggestion back in 2020! Note: Some states do not have data in this dataset. Several states (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah) vote primarily by mail and have little or no data in this colletion, and others were not available for other reasons. For states with data for multiple elections, how have polling location counts per county changed over time?",

See if you can find a better way to present the annual data than theirtable of predictions by year! For anyone not familiar with the Groundhog Day tradition, if the groundhog sees its shadow and goes back into its burrow, that is a prediction of six more weeks of winter. Otherwise spring will come early. We attempted to provide weather data to accompany this dataset, but so far we've been unsuccessful. Watch for a follow-up dataset in the future! Note: \"Oil Springs Ollie\" (groundhog #55) has been succeeded by \"Heaven's Wildlife Harvey\" (groundhog #70).",

        "description": "Happy Valentine's Day! This week we're exploringValentine's Day survey data. The National Retail Federation in the United States conducts surveys and has created aValentine's Day Data Centerso you can explore the data on how consumers celebrate. The NRF has surveyed consumers about how they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade. Take a deeper dive into the data from the last 10 years, and use the interactive charts to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift. The NRF has continued to collect data. The data for this week is from 2010 to 2022, as organized by Suraj Das for a Kaggle dataset. In the historical surveys gender was collected as only 'Men' and 'Women', which does not accurately include all genders. If you're looking for other Valentine's Day type datasets, check out previous datasets onchocolateorboard games(a good Valentine's Day activity!). Data was downloaded fromSunja aa Kaggle dataset. Data from historical_gift_trends_per_person_spending.csv, historical_spending_average_expected_spending.csv and historical_spending_percent_celebrating.csv were combined into historical_spending.csv. Data from planned_gifts_age.csv and spending_or_celebrating_age_1.csv were combined into gifts_age.csv. Data from planned_gifts_gender.csv and spending_or_celebrating_gender_1.csv were combined into gifts_gender.csv. Percentage signs and dollar signs were removed from all numerical values.",
