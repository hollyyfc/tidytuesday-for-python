The Portal Project is a long-term ecological study being conducted near Portal, AZ. Since 1977, the site has been used to study the interactions among rodents, ants and plants and their respective responses to climate. To study the interactions among organisms, they experimentally manipulate access to 24 study plots. This study has produced over 100 scientific papers and is one of the longest running ecological studies in the U.S. TheWeecology research groupmonitors rodents, plants, ants, and weather. All data from the Portal Project are made openly available in near real-time so that they can provide the maximum benefit to scientific research and outreach. The core dataset is managed using an automated living data workflow run using GitHub and Continuous Analysis. This dataset focuses on the rodent data. Full data is available through these resources: The Portal Project data can also be accessed through the Data Retriever, a package manager for data. Data Retriever A teaching focused version of the dataset is also maintained with some of the complexities of the data removed to make it easy to use for computational training purposes. This dataset serves as the core dataset for theData Carpentry Ecologymaterial and has been downloaded almost 50,000 times. Thanks to @ethanwhite for the data cleaning script. This script downloads the data using the{portalr}package. It filters for the species and plot data, and years greater than 1977.",

The data follows certain rules: The two (or more) actors play actual love interests (not just friends, coworkers, or some other non-romantic type of relationship) The youngest of the two actors is at least 17 years old Not animated characters We previously provided a dataset about theBechdel Test. It might be interesting to see whether there is any correlation between these datasets! The Bechdel Test dataset also included additional information about the films that were used in that dataset. Note: The age gaps dataset includes \"gender\" columns, which always contain the values \"man\" or \"woman\". These values appear to indicate how thecharactersin each film identify. Some of these values do not match how theactoridentifies. We apologize if any characters are misgendered in the data!",

        "description": "Doctor Who is an extremely long-running British television program. The show was revived in 2005, and has proven very popular since then. To celebrate this year's 60th anniversary of Doctor Who, we have three datasets. The data this week comes from Wikipedia's [List of Doctor Who episodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(2005%E2%80%93present)via the{datardis} packagebyJonathan Kitt. Thank you to Jonathan for compiling and sharing this data! As of 2023-11-24, the data only includes episodes from the \"revived\" era. For an added challenge, consider submitting a pull request to the {datardis} package to update thedata-extraction scriptsto also fetch the \"classic\" era data! Clean data from the{datardis} package.",

The National Retail Federation in the United States conducts surveys and has created aValentine's Day Data Centerso you can explore the data on how consumers celebrate. The NRF has surveyed consumers about how they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade. Take a deeper dive into the data from the last 10 years, and use the interactive charts to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift. The NRF has continued to collect data. The data for this week is from 2010 to 2022, as organized by Suraj Das for a Kaggle dataset. In the historical surveys gender was collected as only 'Men' and 'Women', which does not accurately include all genders. If you're looking for other Valentine's Day type datasets, check out previous datasets onchocolateorboard games(a good Valentine's Day activity!). Data was downloaded fromSunja aa Kaggle dataset. Data from historical_gift_trends_per_person_spending.csv, historical_spending_average_expected_spending.csv and historical_spending_percent_celebrating.csv were combined into historical_spending.csv. Data from planned_gifts_age.csv and spending_or_celebrating_age_1.csv were combined into gifts_age.csv. Data from planned_gifts_gender.csv and spending_or_celebrating_gender_1.csv were combined into gifts_gender.csv. Percentage signs and dollar signs were removed from all numerical values.",

        "description": "The data this week comes from themedicaldata R package. This is a data package from Peter Higgins, with 19 medical datasets for teaching Reproducible Medical Research with R. We're using thescurvy dataset. Source: This data set is from a study published in 1757 in A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts, by James Lind. This data set contains 12 participants with scurvy. In 1757, it was not known that scurvy is a manifestation of vitamin C deficiency. A variety of remedies had been anecdotally reported, but Lind was the first to test different regimens of acidic substances (including citrus fruits) against each other in a randomized, controlled trial. 6 distinct therapies were tested in 12 seamen with symptomatic scurvy, who were selected for similar severity. Six days of therapy were provided, and endpoints were reported in the text at the end of 6 days. These include rotting of the gums, skin sores, weakness of the knees, and lassitude, which are described in terms of severity. These have been translated into Likert scales from 0(none) to 3(severe). A dichotomous endpoint, fitness for duty, was also reported. Scurvy was a common affliction of seamen on long voyages, leading to mouth sores, skin lesions, weakness of the knees, and lassitude. Scurvy could be fatal on long voyages. James Lind reported the treatment of 12 seamen with scurvy in 1757, in _A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts). This 476 page bloviation can be found scanned to the Google Books website A Treatise on the Scurvy. Pages 149-153 are a rare gem among what can be generously described as 400+ pages of evidence-free blathering, and these 4 pages may represent the first report of a controlled clinical trial. Lind was the ship’s surgeon on board the HMS Salisbury, and had a number of scurvy-affected seamen at his disposal. Many remedies had been described and advocated for, with no more than anecdotal evidence. On May 20, 1747, Lind decided to try the 6 therapies on the Salisbury in a comparative study in 12 affected seamen. He selected 12 with roughly similar severity, with notable skin and mouth sores, weakness of the knees, and significant lassitude, making them unfit for duty. They each received the standard shipboard diet of gruel and mutton broth, supplemented with occasional biscuits and puddings. Each treatment was a dietary supplement (including citrus fruits) or a medicinal. This data frame was reconstructed from Lind’s account as recorded on these 4 pages, with his estimates of severity translated to a 4 point Likert scale (0-3) for each of the symptoms he described at his chosen endpoint on day 6. A somewhat fanciful study_id variable was added, along with detailed descriptions of the dosing schedule of each treatment. Of note, there is some dispute about whether this was truly the first clinical trial, or whether it actually happened, as there are no contemporaneous corroborating accounts. See link about the historical debate. Lind reported that the seamen treated with 2 lemons and an orange daily did best, followed by those treated with cider. Those treated with elixir of vitriol only had improvement in mouth sores. One imagines that acidic substances (like dilute sulfuric acid, vinegar, cider, and citrus fruits) might have been rather painful on these mouth sores. Unfortunately, the burial of the 4 valuable pages of data in 476 pages of noise, a publication delay of 10 years, and Lind’s half-hearted conclusions (he was focused on acidity), meant that it took until 1795 before the British Navy mandated daily limes for seamen. The first column was removed from the scurvy.csv file available athttps://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata/tree/master/data-raw.",

Hat tip this week to theRStudio GitHub Copilot integration, which suggested the MEDSL. From the MEDSL's reportNew Report: How We Voted in 2022: The Survey of the Performance of American Elections (SPAE) provides information about how Americans experienced voting in the most recent federal election. The survey has been conducted after federal elections since 2008, and is the only public opinion project in the country that is dedicated explicitly to understanding how voters themselves experience the election process. We're specifically providing data on House elections from 1976-2022. Check out theMEDSL websitefor additional datasets and tools.
