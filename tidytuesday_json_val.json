We offer free data-related education throughbook clubsand free live question-answering on ourSlack, and by curating a dataset every week here at TidyTuesday. We are now a fiscally sponsored project of Open Collective Foundation (https://opencollective.foundation), a 501(c)(3) public charity. That meansdonations to the R4DS Online Learning Communityare now tax-deductible in the US! It also means that we are now eligible for a number of grants, including some of the grants listed onGrants.gov. We have exported all grants past and present from that site, and we are making them available here for you to explore and visualize. We also scraped details for all posted grants. Please let us know if you find anything interesting!",

        "description": "Our World in Data released anew report on life expectancy, and analysis and interpretations are making the rounds this week, and you can join in too! We had a dataset on Global Life Expectancy on2018-07-03, so if you're a long time tidytuesday-er, this is a chance for some new analyses. The data this week comes theOur World in Data Life Expectancy report, specifically the figures in thekey insightssection. The source for this data is from United Nations World Population Prospects (2022); Human Mortality Database (2023); Zijdeman, Richard and Filipa Ribeira da Silva (2015),Life Expectancy at Birth (Total); Riley, J.C. (2005),Estimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy 1800-2001, Population and Development Review, 31: 537-543. Minor processing by Our World in Data. Across the world, people are living longer. In 1900, the average life expectancy of a newborn was 32 years. By 2021 this had more than doubled to 71 years. But where, when, how, and why has this dramatic change occurred? To understand it, we can look at data on life expectancy worldwide. The large reduction in child mortality has played an important role in increasing life expectancy. But life expectancy has increased at all ages. Infants, children, adults, and the elderly are all less likely to die than in the past, and death is being delayed. This remarkable shift results from advances in medicine, public health, and living standards. Along with it, many predictions of the ‘limit’ of life expectancy have been broken. On the Our World in Data Life Expectancy page, you will find global data and research on life expectancy and related measures of longevity: the probability of death at a given age, the sex gap in life expectancy, lifespan inequality within countries, and more. Data was downloaded from the tables for the figures in theKey Insights sectionof the Life Expectancy article. Column names were changed to make the data easier to work with.",

The data this week comes from theUnion Membership, Coverage, and Earnings from the CPSby Barry Hirsch (Georgia State University), David Macpherson (Trinity University), and William Even (Miami University). They claim a copyright on the data, and state that \"Use of data requires citation.\" Unionstats.com provides annual measures of union, nonunion, and overall wages, beginning in 1973, compiled from the U.S. Current Population Surveys. Regression-based union wage gap estimates are presented economy-wide, for demographic groups, and sectors (private/public, industries). Union wage gaps are higher in the private than in the public sector, higher for men than women, roughly similar for black and white men, and much higher for Hispanic men than for Hispanic women. The database is updated annually. See their open-access article\"Five decades of CPS wages, methods, and union-nonunion wage gaps at Unionstats.com\"for details about their methods and additional visualizations.

        "description": "SinceThe Eras Tour Filmwas just released, this week we're exploring Taylor Swift song data! Are you Ready for It? ThetaylorR package from W. Jake Thompson is a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. The data comes from Genius and the Spotify API. There are three main datasets. The first is taylor_album_songs, which includes lyrics and audio features from the Spotify API for all songs on Taylor’s official studio albums. Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm, etc.), and non-Taylor-owned albums that have a Taylor-owned alternative (e.g., Fearless is excluded in favor of Fearless (Taylor’s Version)). We stan artists owning their own songs. You can access Taylor’s entire discography with taylor_all_songs. This includes all of the songs in taylor_album_songs plus EPs, individual singles, and the original versions of albums that have been re-released as Taylor’s Version. Finally, there is a small data set, taylor_albums, summarizing Taylor’s album release history. Information on the audio features in the dataset from Spotify are included in theirAPI documentation. For your visualizations, the {taylor} package comes with it’s own class of color palettes, inspired by the work of Josiah Parry in the{cpcinema}package. You might also be interested in thetayoRswift packageby Alex Stephenson, a ggplot2 color palette based on Taylor Swift album covers. \"For when your colors absolutely should not be excluded from the narrative.\"",

The National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) is the most comprehensive federal source of childcare prices at the county level. The database offers childcare price data by childcare provider type, age of children, and county characteristics. Data are available from 2008 to 2018. Thanks this week to Thomas Mock for the submission, with a hat tip toJon Schwabish on Twitterfor pointing out the lack of labels on the original government-posted map. Note: This dataset implies that \"both parents\" means one man and one woman. We recognize that this does not reflect the reality of every loving family.",

The CRAN collaboration graph consists of R package developers who are connected if they appear together as authors of an R package in the DESCRIPTION file. The “Hadley number” is defined as the distance of R developers to Hadley Wickham in the collaboration graph. See theREADME of the GitHub projectfor a fun exploration of the data, and to see how it was gathered. SeeWriting R Extensionsfor more information about the fields in this dataset. The data was mostly cleaned byDavid Schoch. Additional cleaning was performed to save simple representations of the graph, and then to check that it worked.",

        "description": "Happy Valentine's Day! This week we're exploringValentine's Day survey data. The National Retail Federation in the United States conducts surveys and has created aValentine's Day Data Centerso you can explore the data on how consumers celebrate. The NRF has surveyed consumers about how they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade. Take a deeper dive into the data from the last 10 years, and use the interactive charts to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift. The NRF has continued to collect data. The data for this week is from 2010 to 2022, as organized by Suraj Das for a Kaggle dataset. In the historical surveys gender was collected as only 'Men' and 'Women', which does not accurately include all genders. If you're looking for other Valentine's Day type datasets, check out previous datasets onchocolateorboard games(a good Valentine's Day activity!). Data was downloaded fromSunja aa Kaggle dataset. Data from historical_gift_trends_per_person_spending.csv, historical_spending_average_expected_spending.csv and historical_spending_percent_celebrating.csv were combined into historical_spending.csv. Data from planned_gifts_age.csv and spending_or_celebrating_age_1.csv were combined into gifts_age.csv. Data from planned_gifts_gender.csv and spending_or_celebrating_gender_1.csv were combined into gifts_gender.csv. Percentage signs and dollar signs were removed from all numerical values.",
