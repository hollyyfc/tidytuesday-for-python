They supplement these data with definitions and a taxonomy of egg products drawn from USDA and industry publications.

The survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data is then sent back to a central server. The server can be used to download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. This is a teaching version of the collected data that we will be using. It is not the full dataset. The survey covered such things as; household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and types of livestock) and details about the household members.

Since urban legends are often a means of expressing our fears about the dangers that ripple just beneath the surface of our seemingly calm and untroubled world, it should come as no surprise that horror legends are one of urban folklore's richest veins. We worry about the terrible accidents we're powerless to prevent, and we fear anonymous killers who choose victims at random. We cannot protect ourselves from the venomous animals who slither undetected into the places where we work, play, and shop, nor can we stop the onslaught of insects who invade our homes and our bodies. We're repulsed by the contaminants that may lurk in our food. We're afraid of foreigners and foreign places. We fear for our childrens' safety in a world full of drugs, kidnappers, and poisons. We never know what gruesome discovery may be waiting around the next corner. And even if we somehow escape all of these horrors, our own vanities may do us in.

We had a dataset on Global Life Expectancy on2018-07-03, so if you're a long time tidytuesday-er, this is a chance for some new analyses. The data this week comes theOur World in Data Life Expectancy report, specifically the figures in thekey insightssection. The source for this data is from United Nations World Population Prospects (2022); Human Mortality Database (2023); Zijdeman, Richard and Filipa Ribeira da Silva (2015),Life Expectancy at Birth (Total); Riley, J.C. (2005),Estimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy 1800-2001, Population and Development Review, 31: 537-543. Minor processing by Our World in Data. Across the world, people are living longer. In 1900, the average life expectancy of a newborn was 32 years. By 2021 this had more than doubled to 71 years. But where, when, how, and why has this dramatic change occurred? To understand it, we can look at data on life expectancy worldwide. The large reduction in child mortality has played an important role in increasing life expectancy. But life expectancy has increased at all ages. Infants, children, adults, and the elderly are all less likely to die than in the past, and death is being delayed. This remarkable shift results from advances in medicine, public health, and living standards. Along with it, many predictions of the \u2018limit\u2019 of life expectancy have been broken.

This is a data package from Peter Higgins, with 19 medical datasets for teaching Reproducible Medical Research with R. We're using thescurvy dataset. Source: This data set is from a study published in 1757 in A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts, by James Lind. This data set contains 12 participants with scurvy. In 1757, it was not known that scurvy is a manifestation of vitamin C deficiency. A variety of remedies had been anecdotally reported, but Lind was the first to test different regimens of acidic substances (including citrus fruits) against each other in a randomized, controlled trial. 6 distinct therapies were tested in 12 seamen with symptomatic scurvy, who were selected for similar severity. Six days of therapy were provided, and endpoints were reported in the text at the end of 6 days. These include rotting of the gums, skin sores, weakness of the knees, and lassitude, which are described in terms of severity. These have been translated into Likert scales from 0(none) to 3(severe). A dichotomous endpoint, fitness for duty, was also reported. Scurvy was a common affliction of seamen on long voyages, leading to mouth sores, skin lesions, weakness of the knees, and lassitude. Scurvy could be fatal on long voyages. James Lind reported the treatment of 12 seamen with scurvy in 1757, in _A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts). This 476 page bloviation can be found scanned to the Google Books website A Treatise on the Scurvy. Pages 149-153 are a rare gem among what can be generously described as 400+ pages of evidence-free blathering, and these 4 pages may represent the first report of a controlled clinical trial. Lind was the ship\u2019s surgeon on board the HMS Salisbury, and had a number of scurvy-affected seamen at his disposal. Many remedies had been described and advocated for, with no more than anecdotal evidence. On May 20, 1747, Lind decided to try the 6 therapies on the Salisbury in a comparative study in 12 affected seamen. He selected 12 with roughly similar severity, with notable skin and mouth sores, weakness of the knees, and significant lassitude, making them unfit for duty. They each received the standard shipboard diet of gruel and mutton broth, supplemented with occasional biscuits and puddings. Each treatment was a dietary supplement (including citrus fruits) or a medicinal. This data frame was reconstructed from Lind\u2019s account as recorded on these 4 pages, with his estimates of severity translated to a 4 point Likert scale (0-3) for each of the symptoms he described at his chosen endpoint on day 6. A somewhat fanciful study_id variable was added, along with detailed descriptions of the dosing schedule of each treatment. Of note, there is some dispute about whether this was truly the first clinical trial, or whether it actually happened, as there are no contemporaneous corroborating accounts. See link about the historical debate. Lind reported that the seamen treated with 2 lemons and an orange daily did best, followed by those treated with cider. Those treated with elixir of vitriol only had improvement in mouth sores.

FeederWatch is a November-April survey of birds that visit backyards, nature centers, community areas, and other locales in North America. Citizen scientists could birds in areas with plantings, habitat, water, or food that attracts birds. The schedule is completely flexible. People count birds as long as they like on days of their choosing, then enter their counts online. This allows anyone to track what is happening to birds around your home and to contribute to a continental data-set of bird distribution and abundance. FeederWatch data show which bird species visit feeders at thousands of locations across the continent every winter. The data also indicate how many individuals of each species are seen. This information can be used to measure changes in the winter ranges and abundances of bird species over time. A subset of the 2021 data is included for this TidyTuesday, but data available through 1988 is available for download onFeederWatch Raw Dataset Downloads page Project FeederWatch is operated by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada.

Are you Ready for It? ThetaylorR package from W. Jake Thompson is a curated data set of Taylor Swift songs, including lyrics and audio characteristics. The data comes from Genius and the Spotify API. There are three main datasets. The first is taylor_album_songs, which includes lyrics and audio features from the Spotify API for all songs on Taylor\u2019s official studio albums. Notably this excludes singles released separately from an album (e.g., Only the Young, Christmas Tree Farm, etc.), and non-Taylor-owned albums that have a Taylor-owned alternative (e.g., Fearless is excluded in favor of Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version)). We stan artists owning their own songs. You can access Taylor\u2019s entire discography with taylor_all_songs. This includes all of the songs in taylor_album_songs plus EPs, individual singles, and the original versions of albums that have been re-released as Taylor\u2019s Version. Finally, there is a small data set, taylor_albums, summarizing Taylor\u2019s album release history. Information on the audio features in the dataset from Spotify are included in theirAPI documentation. For your visualizations, the {taylor} package comes with it\u2019s own class of color palettes, inspired by the work of Josiah Parry in the{cpcinema}package.
