In the first chapterMalcolm Gladwell\u2019s Outliershe discusses how in Canadian Junior Hockey there is a higher likelihood for players to be born in the first quarter of the year. Because these kids are older within their year they make all the important teams at a young age which gets them better resources for skill development and so on. While it seems clear that more players are born in the first few months of the year, what isn\u2019t explored is whether or not this would be expected. Maybe more people in Canada in general are born earlier in the year. I will explore whether Gladwell\u2019s result is expected as well as whether this is still true in today\u2019s NHL for Canadian-born players. Can you reproduce JLaw's results?

This datasets are tables of global and hemispheric monthly means and zonal annual means. They combine land-surface, air and sea-surface water temperature anomalies (Land-Ocean Temperature Index, L-OTI). The values in the tables are deviations from the corresponding 1951-1980 means. The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis version 4 (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change. Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using current data files from NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations) and ERSST v5 (ocean areas), combined as described in their publications Hansen et al. (2010) and Lenssen et al. (2019). These updated files incorporate reports for the previous month and also late reports and corrections for earlier months. When comparing seasonal temperatures, it is convenient to use \u201cmeteorological seasons\u201d based on temperature and defined as groupings of whole months. Thus, Dec-Jan-Feb (DJF) is the Northern Hemisphere meteorological winter, Mar-Apr-May (MAM) is N.H. meteorological spring, Jun-Jul-Aug (JJA) is N.H. meteorological summer and Sep-Oct-Nov (SON) is N.H. meteorological autumn. String these four seasons together and you have the meteorological year that begins on Dec. 1 and ends on Nov. 30 (D-N). The full year is Jan to Dec (J-D).Brian Bartling An analysis and more information on the data can be found in Lenssen, N., G. Schmidt, J. Hansen, M. Menne, A. Persin, R. Ruedy, and D.

Take a deeper dive into the data from the last 10 years, and use the interactive charts to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift. The NRF has continued to collect data. The data for this week is from 2010 to 2022, as organized by Suraj Das for a Kaggle dataset. In the historical surveys gender was collected as only 'Men' and 'Women', which does not accurately include all genders.
